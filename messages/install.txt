Thank you for installing WindowMode. In the bottom left corner of the
status bar, you'll see the current mode your window is in from now on.

* Displays `FILE MODE` if you opened a single file without a folder hierarchy.
* Displays `FOLDER MODE` if you opened a folder.
* Displays `PROJECT MODE` if you opened a project.
